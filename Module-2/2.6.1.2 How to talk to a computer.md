The input() function with an argument
=====================================

The `input()` function can do something else: it can prompt the user without any help from `print()`.

We've modified our example a bit, look at the code:

`anything = input("Tell me anything...") print("Hmm...", anything, "...Really?")`

Note:

-   the `input()` function is invoked with one argument - it's a string containing a message;
-   the message will be displayed on the console before the user is given an opportunity to enter anything;
-   `input()` will then do its job.

This variant of the `input()` invocation simplifies the code and makes it clearer.

The result of the input() function
==================================

We've said it already, but it must be unambiguously stated once again: the **result of the `input()` function is a string**.

A string containing all the characters the user enters from the keyboard. It is not an integer or a float.

This means that **you mustn't use it as an argument of any arithmetic operation**, e.g., you can't use this data to square it, divide it by anything, or divide anything by it.

`anything = input("Enter a number: ") something = anything ** 2.0 print(anything, "to the power of 2 is", something)`
