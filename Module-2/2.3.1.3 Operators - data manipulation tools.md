Arithmetic operators: multiplication
====================================

An `*` (asterisk) sign is a **multiplication** operator.

Run the code below and check if our *integer vs. float* rule is still working.

`print(2 * 3)`

`print(2 * 3.)`

`print(2. * 3)`

`print(2. * 3.)`

Arithmetic operators: division
==============================

A `/` (slash) sign is a **divisional** operator.

The value in front of the slash is a **dividend**, the value behind the slash, a **divisor**.

Run the code below and analyze the results.

`

print(6 / 3)

print(6 / 3.)

print(6. / 3)

print(6. / 3.)

`

You should see that there is an exception to the rule.

**The result produced by the division operator is always a float**, regardless of whether or not the result seems to be a float at first glance: `1 / 2`, or if it looks like a pure integer: `2 / 1`.

Is this a problem? Yes, it is. It happens sometimes that you really need a division that provides an integer value, not a float.

Fortunately, Python can help you with that.
