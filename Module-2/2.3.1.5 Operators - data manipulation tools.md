Operators: remainder (modulo)
=============================

The next operator is quite a peculiar one, because it has no equivalent among traditional arithmetic operators.

Its graphical representation in Python is the `%` (percent) sign, which may look a bit confusing.

Try to think of it as of a slash (division operator) accompanied by two funny little circles.

The result of the operator is a **remainder left after the integer division**.

In other words, it's the value left over after dividing one value by another to produce an integer quotient.

Note: the operator is sometimes called **modulo** in other programming languages.

Take a look at the snippet - try to predict its result and then run it:

`

print(14 % 4)

`

As you can see, the result is two. This is why:

-   `14 // 4` gives `3` → this is the integer **quotient**;
-   `3 * 4` gives `12` → as a result of **quotient and divisor multiplication**;
-   `14 - 12` gives `2` → this is the **remainder**.

This example is somewhat more complicated:

`

print(12 % 4.5)

`

What is the result?

Operators: how not to divide
============================

As you probably know, **division by zero doesn't work**.

Do **not** try to:

-   perform a division by zero;
-   perform an integer division by zero;
-   find a remainder of a division by zero.
