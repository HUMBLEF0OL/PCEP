Strings
=======

Strings are used when you need to process text (like names of all kinds, addresses, novels, etc.), not numbers.

You already know a bit about them, e.g., that **strings need quotes** the way floats need points.

This is a very typical string: `"I am a string."`

However, there is a catch. The catch is how to encode a quote inside a string which is already delimited by quotes.

Let's assume that we want to print a very simple message saying:

`I like "Monty Python"`

How do we do it without generating an error? There are two possible solutions.

The first is based on the concept we already know of the **escape character**, which you should remember is played by the **backslash**. The backslash can escape quotes too. A quote preceded by a backslash changes its meaning - it's not a delimiter, but just a quote. This will work as intended:

`

print("I like \"Monty Python\"")

`

Note: there are two escaped quotes inside the string - can you see them both?

The second solution may be a bit surprising. Python can use **an apostrophe instead of a quote**. Either of these characters may delimit strings, but you must be **consistent**.

If you open a string with a quote, you have to close it with a quote.

If you start a string with an apostrophe, you have to end it with an apostrophe.

This example will work too:

`

print('I like "Monty Python"')

`

Note: you don't need to do any escaping here.
