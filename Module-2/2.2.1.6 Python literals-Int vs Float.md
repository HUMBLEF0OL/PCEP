Ints vs. floats
===============

The decimal point is essentially important in recognizing floating-point numbers in Python.

Look at these two numbers:

`4 4.0`

You may think that they are exactly the same, but Python sees them in a completely different way.

`4` is an **integer** number, whereas `4.0` is a **floating-point** number.

The point is what makes a float.

On the other hand, it's not only points that make a float. You can also use the letter `e`.

When you want to use any numbers that are very large or very small, you can use **scientific notation**.

Take, for example, the speed of light, expressed in *meters per second*. Written directly it would look like this: `300000000`.

To avoid writing out so many zeros, physics textbooks use an abbreviated form, which you have probably already seen: `3 x 10^8^`.

It reads: three times ten to the power of eight.

In Python, the same effect is achieved in a slightly different way - take a look:

`3E8`

The letter `E` (you can also use the lower-case letter `e` - it comes from the word **exponent**) is a concise record of the phrase *times ten to the power of*.

Note:

-   the **exponent** (the value after the *E*) has to be an integer;
-   the **base** (the value in front of the *E*) may be an integer.
