Operators and their bindings: exponentiation
============================================

Repeat the experiment, but now with exponentiation.

Use this snippet of code:

`

print(2 ** 2 ** 3)

`

The two possible results are:

-   `2 ** 2` → `4`; `4 ** 3` → `64`
-   `2 ** 3` → `8`; `2 ** 8` → `256`

Run the code. What do you see?

The result clearly shows that **the exponentiation operator uses right-sided binding**.
