Key takeaways
=============

1\. Comments can be used to leave additional information in code. They are omitted at runtime. The information left in source code is addressed to human readers. In Python, a comment is a piece of text that begins with `#`. The comment extends to the end of line.

2\. If you want to place a comment that spans several lines, you need to place `#` in front of them all. Moreover, you can use a comment to mark a piece of code that is not needed at the moment (see the last line of the snippet below), e.g.:

`# This program prints # an introduction to the screen. print("Hello!") # Invoking the print() function # print("I'm Python.")`

3\. Whenever possible and justified, you should give **self-commenting names** to variables, e.g., if you're using two variables to store a length and width of something, the variable names `length` and `width` may be a better choice than `myvar1` and `myvar2`.

4\. It's important to use comments to make programs easier to understand, and to use readable and meaningful variable names in code. However, it's equally important **not to use** variable names that are confusing, or leave comments that contain wrong or incorrect information!

5\. Comments can be important when *you* are reading your own code after some time (trust us, developers do forget what their own code does), and when *others* are reading your code (can help them understand what your programs do and how they do it more quickly).
