List of priorities
==================

Since you're new to Python operators, we don't want to present the complete list of operator priorities right now.

Instead, we'll show you a truncated form, and we'll expand it consistently as we introduce new operators.

Look at the table below:

|   |   |

| Priority | Operator |

| 1 | `**` |  |

| 2 | `+`, `-` (note: unary operators located next to the right of the power operator bind more strongly) | unary |

| 3 | `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` |  |

| 4 | `+`, `-` | binary |

|__ |__ |

Note: we've enumerated the operators in order **from the highest (1) to the lowest (4) priorities**.

Try to work through the following expression:

`

print(2 * 3 % 5)

`

Both operators (`*` and `%`) have the same priority, so the result can be guessed only when you know the binding direction. What do you think? What is the result?

Operators and parentheses
=========================

Of course, you're always allowed to use **parentheses**, which can change the natural order of a calculation.

In accordance with the arithmetic rules, **subexpressions in parentheses are always calculated first**.

You can use as many parentheses as you need, and they're often used to **improve the readability** of an expression, even if they don't change the order of the operations.

An example of an expression with multiple parentheses is here:

`

print((5 * ((25 % 13) + 100) / (2 * 13)) // 2)

`

Try to compute the value that's printed to the console. What's the result of the `print()` function?
