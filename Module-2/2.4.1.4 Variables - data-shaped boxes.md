Using variables
===============

You're allowed to use as many variable declarations as you need to achieve your goal, like this:

`

var = 1

account_balance = 1000.0

client_name = 'John Doe'

print(var, account_balance, client_name)

print(var)

`

You're **not allowed to use a variable which doesn't exist** (in other words, a variable that was not assigned a value).

This example will **cause an error**:

`var = 1 print(Var)`

We've tried to use a variable named `Var`, which doesn't have any value (note: `var` and `Var` are different entities, and have nothing in common as far as Python's concerned).

**REMEMBER**

You can use the `print()` function and combine text and variables using the `+` operator to output strings and variables, e.g.:

`var = "3.8.5" print("Python version: " + var)`

Can you guess the output of the snippet above?
