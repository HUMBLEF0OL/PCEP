Coding floats
=============

Let's see how this convention is used to record numbers that are very small (in the sense of their absolute value, which is close to zero).

A physical constant called *Planck's constant* (and denoted as *h*), according to the textbooks, has the value of: **6.62607 x 10^-34^**.

If you would like to use it in a program, you should write it this way:

`6.62607E-34`

Note: the fact that you've chosen one of the possible forms of coding float values doesn't mean that Python will present it the same way.

Python may sometimes choose **different notation** than you.

For example, let's say you've decided to use the following float literal:

`0.0000000000000000000001`

When you run this literal through Python:

`

print(0.0000000000000000000001)

`

this is the result:

`1e-22`

**output**

Python always chooses **the more economical form of the number's presentation**, and you should take this into consideration when creating literals.
