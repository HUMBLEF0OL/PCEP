Key takeaways
=============

1\. **Literals** are notations for representing some fixed values in code. Python has various types of literals - for example, a literal can be a number (numeric literals, e.g., `123`), or a string (string literals, e.g., "I am a literal.").

2\. The **binary system** is a system of numbers that employs *2* as the base. Therefore, a binary number is made up of 0s and 1s only, e.g., `1010` is *10* in decimal.

Octal and hexadecimal numeration systems, similarly, employ *8* and *16* as their bases respectively. The hexadecimal system uses the decimal numbers and six extra letters.

3\. **Integers** (or simply **int**s) are one of the numerical types supported by Python. They are numbers written without a fractional component, e.g., `256`, or `-1` (negative integers).

4\. **Floating-point** numbers (or simply **float**s) are another one of the numerical types supported by Python. They are numbers that contain (or are able to contain) a fractional component, e.g., `1.27`.

5\. To encode an apostrophe or a quote inside a string you can either use the escape character, e.g., `'I\'m happy.'`, or open and close the string using an opposite set of symbols to the ones you wish to encode, e.g., `"I'm happy."` to encode an apostrophe, and `'He said "Python", not "typhoon"'` to encode a (double) quote.

6\. **Boolean values** are the two constant objects `True` and `False` used to represent truth values (in numeric contexts `1` is `True`, while `0` is `False`.

**EXTRA**

There is one more, special literal that is used in Python: the `None` literal. This literal is a so-called `NoneType` object, and it is used to represent **the absence of a value**. We'll tell you more about it soon.

`"Hello ", "007"`\


**Exercise 2**

What types of literals are the following four examples?

`"1.5", 2.0, 528, False`\


**Exercise 3**
