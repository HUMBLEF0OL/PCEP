Shortcut operators
==================

It's time for the next set of operators that make a developer's life easier.

Very often, we want to use one and the same variable both to the right and left sides of the `=` operator.

For example, if we need to calculate a series of successive values of powers of 2, we may use a piece like this:

`x = x * 2`

You may use an expression like this if you can't fall asleep and you're trying to deal with it using some good, old-fashioned methods:

`sheep = sheep + 1`

Python offers you a shortened way of writing operations like these, which can be coded as follows:

`x *= 2 sheep += 1`

Let's try to present a general description for these operations.

If `op` is a two-argument operator (this is a very important condition) and the operator is used in the following context:

`variable = variable op expression`

It can be simplified and shown as follows:

`variable op= expression`

Take a look at the examples below. Make sure you understand them all.

`i = i + 2 * j` ⇒ `i += 2 * j`

`var = var / 2` ⇒ `var /= 2`

`rem = rem % 10` ⇒ `rem %= 10`

`j = j - (i + var + rem)` ⇒ `j -= (i + var + rem)`

`x = x ** 2` ⇒ `x **= 2`
