Arithmetic operators: exponentiation
====================================

A `**` (double asterisk) sign is an **exponentiation** (power) operator. Its left argument is the **base**, its right, the **exponent**.

Classical mathematics prefers notation with superscripts, just like this: **2^3^**. Pure text editors don't accept that, so Python uses `**` instead, e.g., `2 ** 3`.

Take a look at our examples in the editor window.

Note: we've surrounded the double asterisks with spaces in our examples. It's not compulsory, but it improves the **readability** of the code.

The examples show a very important feature of virtually all Python **numerical operators**.

Run the code and look carefully at the results it produces. Can you see any regularity here?

**Remember**: It's possible to formulate the following rules based on this result:

-   when **both** `**` arguments are integers, the result is an integer, too;
-   when **at least one** `**` argument is a float, the result is a float, too.

This is an important distinction to remember.
